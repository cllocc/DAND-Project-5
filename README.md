<p><strong>Communicate Data Findings</strong></p>
<p>This project was completed as part of the course requirements of Udacity's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002">Data Analyst Nanodegree</a>&nbsp;certification.</p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>In this project we will explore open data from Bay Wheels. A bike sharing program located within the bay area of California. First we will explore the data visually then present our findings in a Jupyter notebook slide show.</p>
<p><strong>The Project Involved:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Exploring and wrangling Bay Wheel data.</li>
<li>Assessing data for quality and tidiness</li>
<li>Cleaning, analysis and visualization.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tech Used</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Jupyter Notebook (Data Science work book)</li>
<li>SQLite3 (<em>Database and querying</em>)</li>
<li>Pandas (<em>very robust library for data analysis)</em></li>
<li>Numpy (<em>library for scientific computing</em>)</li>
<li>Matplotlib (library for robust plotting visualizations)</li>
<li>Seaborn (<em>statistical data visualization</em>)</li>
<li>OS (<em>Provides function for interacting with the operating system</em>)</li>
<li>Geopandas (Goegraphical Mapping)</li>
<li>CSV (Reading csv Files)</li>
<li>Gmaps (Connecting to the google maps API)</li>
<li>Shapely(A Library for working with geo data) &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Key Findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our users are predominantly male.</li>
<li>We have over a 160,000 subscribers and over 40,000 customers.</li>
<li>Our most popular start stations vs least popular start stations differ vastly.</li>
<li>There are areas and cities where the program is unavailable.</li>
<li>There is a station in Canada based on the data</li>
</ul>
<p>More Questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can we gain more female subscribers?</li>
<li>Can we turn our customers into subscribers?</li>
<li>Are the low traffic stations viable?</li>
<li>How do we add more stations in high traffic areas for cities where the bike share program is unavailable?</li>
<li>Why is there a station in Canada?</li>
</ul>
